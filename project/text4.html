<h1><font color="#FFFFFF">Brief description of the datasets</font></h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Round Hill dataset:</b> Originally there were two Round Hill datasets, created by conducting two individual experiments. One was conducted from August 1954 to November 1955 (29 releases) and the other was from September 1957 to December 1957 (10 releases), near the Round Hill Field Station of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. SO2 was used as the tracer gas in both experiments. Our dataset was created by merging these two datasets and contained a total of 39 releases.</li>
<li><b>Prairie Grass dataset:</b> The experiment was carried out in an open country in Oâ€™Neil, Nebraska from July to August 1956. SO2 was used as the tracer gas. The dataset contained a total of 68 releases.</li>
