<ul>
<li>Original datasets were chaotic and had to be pre-processed first. </li>
<li>Then, the datasets were divided into a train set, a validation set, and a test set. </li>
<li>For the Round Hill dataset, experiment numbers 14,15,26,32,33 were used as the test set, and the remaining 34 experiments were used as train and validation sets. </li>
<li>For the Prairie Grass dataset, experiment numbers 19,27,37,57,67 were used as the test set, and the remaining 63 experiments were used as train and validation sets.</li>
<li>All the features were normalized before use.</li>
<li>Various hyper-parameters of the models were tuned by testing modelâ€™s performance on the validation set.</li>
<li>Finally the models were tested on the hold-out test set.</li>
</ul>
