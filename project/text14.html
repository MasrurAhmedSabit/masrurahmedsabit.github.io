<li>All three models performed reasonably well even with these small datasets and few features.</li>
<li>Predicting negative concentration was a problem found in many relevant studies. But none of the models tested in our work predicted any negative concentration.</li>
<li>Overall, Neural Network showed the best accuracy and k-NN was the simplest and easiest.</li>
<li>Random Forest showed better fitting abilities for higher concentrations than Neural Network.	</li>
<li>The performance of both Random Forest and Neural Network will be even better if a bigger dataset is supplied. Using more input features can also improve modelâ€™s performance.</li>
